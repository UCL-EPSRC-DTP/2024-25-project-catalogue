Project Summary:

Spasticity is a neurological condition where a patient has increased and abnormal muscle tone and stiffness, which can affect joint movement and cause pain. In recent years, focal vibro-tactile stimulation combined with robotic therapy has been shown to reduce muscle tone and joint stiffness and contribute to improved function and reduced pain in SCI patients. However, the mechanisms by which vibrations lead to these physiological changes are unknown. Using a highly novel in vitro approach, this project aims to characterise the response of tissue engineered skeletal muscle to vibrations, with the aim of informing future pre-clinical and clinical investigations. A combination of cellular and molecular techniques, as well as the biomechanical assessment of the tissue will be used. This project is born out of patient-expressed need and is a unique collaboration between engineers, muscle cell experts and clinicians.
