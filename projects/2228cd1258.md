Project Summary:

There is an evolving need for the development and validation of cost-effective scalable vaccine delivery platforms with the aim to support safe and effective immunisations for both human and veterinary health at global scale.  In this interdisciplinary multi-Faculty PhD programme, we will apply an integrative vaccine development approach to study the scalability of phage vaccine delivery systems and its relation with their safety and immunogenicity. This project contributes to our preparedness to future zoonosis or other pathogens of interests all in the context of human and veterinary health.
