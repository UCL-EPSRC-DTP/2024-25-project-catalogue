Project Summary:

The project will study the dynamics of resistance switching in silicon oxide-based memristors. While we have some understanding of the basic physical mechanisms underlying resistance switching, control of the dynamics of resistance changes is patchy. In this project the student will analyse time- and frequency-domain data from memristors operating in both the sub-threshold and above threshold regimes. In the former, the dynamics are a complex interplay between applied field, carrier mobility, charge trapping and ion motion. Through a series of electrical and structural studies the student will attempt to disentangle these contributions and provide schemes to facilitate control of device behaviour over different timescales. In the latter, the project will study how random telegraph noise in the frequency domain can yield information on the formation and disruption of conductive filaments in filamentary resistance switching. There will be a possibility for the student to access devices and data from the spin-out company Intrinsic Semiconductor Technologies ltd, and it is possible that we may be able to arrange short research visits to Imec in Belgium, who are working with Intrinsic to translate their devices from lab to fab.
