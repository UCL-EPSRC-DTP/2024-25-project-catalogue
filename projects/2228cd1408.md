Project Summary:

The proposed research will investigate aspects of algebraic and analytic number theory, and arithmetic geometry. Some computational methods may be involved. Potential directions include: 

- the arithmetic of elliptic curves and of Jacobians of higher genus curves, and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.  

- the analytic theory of L-functions and automorphic forms. 

- the arithmetic and cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. 

- the p-adic Langlands programme, especially the cohomology of arithmetic groups and their p-adic Banach space representations.  

- Shimura varieties and the Andre-Oort conjecture.
