Project Summary:


This project will develop mist CVD for making new transparent conducting oxide on glass and other substrates. 

The aim is to make materials with better performance characteristics and to understand the underpinning chemistry.  The project will include some precursor synthesis, thin film growth and characterisation of the new materials.  

The project will be done in conjunction with Pilkington Glass (also known as NSG).  A placement will be arranged for three months at NSG and if things go well look at scale up onto an industrial scale.
