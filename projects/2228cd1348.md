Project Summary:

Diabetic patients have increased number of fractures and increased change of impaired fracture healing. Current biomaterial and tissue engineering approaches for bone repair and regeneration do not take into account the unique diabetic environment and effects of hyperglycaemia on bone regeneration. This project investigates if a more personalised approach is needed, with the creation of regenerative biomaterials specific to diabetic patients.
