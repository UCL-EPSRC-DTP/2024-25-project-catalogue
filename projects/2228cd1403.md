Project Summary:

Mathematical Modelling is a key contributor in many, perhaps almost every, branch of science,â€¯engineering, technology, medicine as well as architecture, planning, commerce, arts, humanities and much more. Research methods involve analytical, asymptotic, numerical and statistical techniques. Research studies are undertaken include modelling for such diverse topics as security and screening issues, crime propagation, social dynamics, spatial analysis, biochemical engineering applications, industrial projects, sand and dust movement, crowd behaviour, sediment transport, fire spreading, food sorting, Olympic cycling, ice formation on aircraft, melting and solidification problems, traffic, econophysics, carbon recycling and filtration.  

A particular focus is the application of operational research, data analysis and mathematical modelling to problems in health care. Projects in this area include work with local NHS organisations, those informing national health policy and improving national services for congenital heart disease.
