Project Summary:

This project will involve studying examples and developing theoretical tools in various areas of geometry and topology. This may include topics influenced by mathematical physics, including gauge theory, topological field theory, and dynamical systems. 

 Specific themes that may be covered include calibrated geometry, geometric measure theory, geometric representation theory and the geometric Langlands programme, symplectic topology, moduli spaces, geometric group theory, birational geometry, and derived categories.
