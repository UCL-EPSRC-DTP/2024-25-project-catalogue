Project Summary:

Solar energy technology offers a promising avenue for reducing our fossil fuel dependency and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Halide perovskites emerge as an enticing candidate for the next generation of high-performance solar cells, boasting remarkable
power conversion efficiencies exceeding 26%. Particularly intriguing are lightweight and flexible perovskite photovoltaic devices, which have garnered significant attention for potential applications in wearable electronics, miniaturized drones, blimps, high-resolution screens, and aerospace electronics. However, widespread commercial use of these halide perovskites faces several challenges, including issues related to lead toxicity, sensitivity to air and moisture, and phase instability. Furthermore, the mechanical properties, such as strength and toughness, require in-depth investigation, with bendability being a critical characteristic for functional layers in wearable devices before entering the flexible
electronics market. This project will concentrate on designing, synthesizing, and processing eco-friendly materials, including lead-free halide perovskites, for use as absorber layers. It will also
explore new types of charge transport electrodes, interfacial interlayers, and encapsulation materials for flexible solar cells. The research will involve characterizing thin films and solar cells using advanced techniques such as time-resolved photoluminescence and impedance spectroscopy, as well as structural and morphological analysis to correlate charge transport properties with material structure and solar cell performance and stability.

Applicants should possess, or be on track to achieve, a first or upper second-class Honours degree or its equivalent in materials science/engineering, chemistry, physics, electrical/chemical engineering, or related fields, with a minimum of four years of university level study. The successful candidate will conduct research in the state-of-the-art Functional Materials and Energy Device group, led by Dr. Mojtaba Abdi-Jalebi at the Institute for Materials
Discovery at UCL. This highly interdisciplinary research will involve collaboration with national and international academic and industrial partners, fostering a dynamic, collaborative, and diverse environment among a team of talented researchers.
