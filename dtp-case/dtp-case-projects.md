### DTP-CASE projects

This page lists all the available DTP-CASE projects.

DTP-CASE projects have an industrial partner, and involve time spent on placement at the partner’s premises. More information about DTP-CASE studentships can be found on the [UCL EPSRC DTP’s website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)
